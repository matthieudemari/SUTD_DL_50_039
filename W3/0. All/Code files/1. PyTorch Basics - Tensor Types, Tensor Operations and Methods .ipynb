    "### On the benefits of using PyTorch to implement a Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several benefits to using PyTorch over NumPy for implementing neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PyTorch provides a more intuitive interface for working with tensors and neural networks. NumPy is primarily a numerical computing library, and while it can be used to perform operations on arrays that are similar to those used in neural networks, PyTorch is specifically designed with deep learning in mind and provides a more natural and convenient interface for defining and training neural networks.\n",
    "- PyTorch has better support for GPU acceleration than NumPy. If a GPU is available, it can significantly speed up the training of our neural network by performing the computations on the GPU using PyTorch. This can be especially useful for training large and complex models.\n",
    "- PyTorch includes a number of high-level abstractions for building and training neural networks, such as nn.Module, nn.Sequential, and optim. These abstractions make it easier to write and debug code, and can also improve the performance of our model by allowing PyTorch to apply optimization techniques such as graph fusion and automatic differentiation (which is nice as we will no longer have to worry about the gradient update rules to use!).\n",
    "- PyTorch has a large and active community of users, coming witha wealth of online resources and documentation to help troubleshoot any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing, but PyTorch is a more effective choice for implementing and training neural networks, especially if when taking advantage of GPU acceleration or when using more advanced features such as automatic differentiation."
