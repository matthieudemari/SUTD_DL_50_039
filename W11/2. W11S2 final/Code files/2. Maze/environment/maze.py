    A maze with walls. An agent is placed at the start cell and must find the exit cell by moving through the maze.

    The layout of the maze and the rules how to move through it are called the environment. An agent is placed
    at start_cell. The agent chooses actions (move left/right/up/down) in order to reach the exit_cell. Every
    action results in a reward or penalty which are accumulated during the game. Every move gives a small
    penalty (-0.05), returning to a cell the agent visited earlier a bigger penalty (-0.25) and running into
    a wall a large penalty (-0.75). The reward (+10.0) is collected when the agent reaches the exit. The
    game always reaches a terminal state; the agent either wins or looses. Obviously reaching the exit means
    winning, but if the penalties the agent is collecting during play exceed a certain threshold the agent is
    assumed to wander around clueless and looses.

    A note on cell coordinates:
    The cells in the maze are stored as (col, row) or (x, y) tuples. (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the maze.
    This way of storing coordinates is in line with what matplotlib's plot() function expects as inputs. The maze
    itself is stored as a 2D numpy array so cells are accessed via [row, col]. To convert a (col, row) tuple
    to (row, col) use: (col, row)[::-1]
